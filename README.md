# Lefty VRMod
A modified version of VRMod for GMod that allows you to use your left hand for weapons and tools.  

**WARNING:** The modifications I've made are barely above hacky, as such there are issues, the only one I've found that I don't know how to fix is using world models no longer works in either right or left handed mode.
